This C++ program is designed to efficiently analyze a ledger file containing up to 1000 entries of Zentharian navigators, each holding a unique configuration of up to 20 quantum fuel crystals. Each entry in the ledger represents the fuel quantities stored within these crystals, and the program aims to pinpoint the navigator carrying the maximum fuel load among all entries.

The program performs the following actions:

Ledger File Parsing: Reads and processes each line from the ledger file, dynamically populating an array of Zentharian structures, each storing an integer array of fuel values for up to 20 crystals. This parser ensures data accuracy by handling each line individually and accounts for any ledger anomalies (e.g., blank lines).
Fuel Calculation: For each navigator, the program calculates the cumulative quantum fuel from their individual fuel crystals, storing this total within the structure.
Max-Fuel Navigator Identification: Traverses all fuel totals to identify the navigator with the highest quantum fuel load, storing the index and total fuel for streamlined output.
Detailed Output Generation: Once identified, the program generates an output detailing the specific navigator, listing each crystalâ€™s fuel content followed by the cumulative quantum fuel, formatted for readability.
This implementation prioritizes efficient data handling and scalability, utilizing a fixed-size vector array and constant integer limits for quick access and optimized memory management.
